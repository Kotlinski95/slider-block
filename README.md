# Slider Block plugin

__Fork it, or download the [latest release](https://github.com/colorful-tones/slider-block/releases), and make it your own!__

This is a demonstration of how you might create a custom [Slider Block](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/), which is a slider carousel UI. We're using SwiperJS (3rd-party dependency) for the slider JavaScript and CSS (mostly).

## Installation

### Manual

1. Upload the `slider-block` folder to the plugins directory (typically `wp-content/plugins`) in your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the Slider Block plugin.
3. Create a new post or page, and insert the Slider block.
4. That's it.

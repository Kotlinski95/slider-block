# Slider Block plugin

This is a demonstration of how you might create a custom Slider Block, which is a slider carousel UI. We're using SwiperJS (3rd-party dependency) for the slider JavaScript and CSS (mostly).

## Installation

### Manual

1. Upload the `slider-block` folder to the plugins directory (typically `wp-content/plugins`) in your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the Slider Block plugin.
3. Create a new post or page, and insert the Slider block.
4. That's it.
